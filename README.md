## Overview

StealthRelay is a self-hosted Rust relay server that routes WebSocket messages between [ConnectionPool](https://github.com/Olib-AI/ConnectionPool) peers without ever seeing their content. All application data is end-to-end encrypted using a Noise NK handshake (dual X25519 DH) with ChaCha20-Poly1305 session ciphers — the server handles only opaque blobs.

The relay operates on a zero-knowledge model: deploy it on your own infrastructure, claim ownership via a one-time QR code, and invite friends through cryptographically signed invitation URLs. The server authenticates hosts with Ed25519 signatures and protects against abuse with adaptive proof-of-work, per-IP rate limiting, and progressive blocking.

Five Rust crates, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on all of them, 166 unit tests, and 30 E2E tests.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

**One-line install** (Linux / macOS / Raspberry Pi):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows** (run PowerShell as Administrator):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer downloads a pre-built binary, verifies its SHA256 checksum, creates a system service, and starts the server. No Docker, no dependencies.

> **Prefer Docker?** See [Docker Compose](#docker-compose) or [One-Click Cloud Deploy](#one-click-deploy) below.

### 2. Claim the Server

After installation, a **setup page** opens automatically in your browser:

<p align="center">
  <code>http://localhost:9091/setup?token=&lt;TOKEN&gt;</code>
</p>

The setup page displays a **QR code** — scan it with the StealthOS app to claim ownership. You can also copy the manual code from the page.

> **Security:** The setup URL includes a one-time token that is only printed to the server console. Without this token, the page returns 403 Forbidden — even if someone can reach port 9091.

> **Headless / Raspberry Pi?** Open the setup URL from any device on your local network. The installer prints the LAN-accessible URL to the terminal.

Open **StealthOS** → **Connection Pool** → **Host Remote Pool**:
- Enter your server URL (`ws://your-ip:9090`)
- Tap **Scan QR Code** and point your camera at the setup page
- Or tap **Enter Code Manually** and paste the code

The server is now bound to your device. A **recovery key** is shown once — **save it securely**. It is the only way to reclaim the server if you lose your device.

### 3. Create an Invitation in the App

Once claimed, tap **"Invite a Friend"** in the pool lobby. Share the generated link or QR code.

### 4. Share and Connect

When friends open the invitation:
- The server forwards their join request to you
- You approve or reject from your device
- Any connected member can also create invite links — but **you always approve**

Chat, play games, share files — all end-to-end encrypted. The server routes messages but can never read them.

## How It Works

```

## Features

### Protocol Security

- **Noise NK handshake** — Dual X25519 Diffie-Hellman with HKDF-SHA256 key derivation for forward-secret session establishment
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305 session cipher** — Authenticated encryption for all application data with automatic symmetric ratchet at 2^20 messages
- **Ed25519 host authentication** — Domain-separated timestamp signatures verified by the relay before pool creation
- **HMAC invitation tokens** — 256-bit tokens with HKDF derivation and constant-time comparison; one-time use, time-limited, host approval required
- **Server claiming** — One-time 256-bit QR code visible only in Docker logs; per-IP rate-limited with progressive blocking and recovery key fallback
- **Host key integrity** — Identity key files use a v2 format with 4-byte magic (`STKY`), 32-byte seed, and 32-byte BLAKE2b-256 MAC; corruption or tampering is detected on load
- **Session tokens** — 32-byte server-issued tokens required for all privileged host operations and guest `Forward` frames (constant-time comparison)
- **Display name sanitization** — Control characters, newlines, and excessive length (>64 chars) stripped before logging or storage

### Anti-Abuse

- **Adaptive proof-of-work** — SHA-256 hashcash with difficulty that scales from 18-bit (~50ms) to 26-bit (~13s) based on request rate
- **Per-IP rate limiting** — Connection rate, message rate, and failed authentication tracking with IPv6 /48 normalization
- **Progressive blocking** — IPs exceeding limits are blocked for configurable durations (default 10 minutes)
- **JSON depth bomb defense** — Recursive nesting in `SessionResumed` frames is structurally prevented by using flat `BufferedRelayedMessage` types
- **64 KB message cap** — Oversized WebSocket frames are rejected before processing
- **Connection registry cleanup** — Connections are properly unregistered on disconnect, preventing `active_count` drift from blocking new connections

### Operations

- **Docker-first deployment** — Multi-stage build producing a minimal Debian image with no shell
- **Cloudflare Tunnel support** — Production deployment via `cloudflared` sidecar for TLS termination without managing certificates
- **Native TLS** — Optional `rustls` with SPKI SHA-256 pin verification for direct TLS termination
- **Recovery key** — One-time recovery key issued at claim time for server rebinding if the host device is lost
- **Graceful shutdown** — Signal handling with connection draining
- **Mutex poison recovery** — All `claim_state` mutex accesses recover from poison (via `PoisonError::into_inner`) instead of panicking, preventing a single thread panic from killing the server
- **`Arc<str>` broadcast** — Broadcast messages share one `Arc<str>` allocation across all recipients instead of cloning per-peer, reducing allocation pressure for large pools

### Observability

- **Structured logging** — JSON or pretty output via `tracing` with per-crate filter directives
- **Prometheus metrics** — Connection counts, pool counts, message rates exposed on a dedicated metrics port
- **Health endpoint** — JSON health status with built-in Docker `HEALTHCHECK`

## Security

Security is not bolted on — it is structural. Every layer enforces its own guarantees.

### Server Authentication (Ed25519)

The host authenticates to the relay by signing `pool_id || timestamp || nonce` with a Keychain-stored Ed25519 private key. The relay verifies the signature against the bound host public key before creating a pool. On each new WebSocket connection, the server issues a per-connection nonce via an `auth_challenge` frame. The host must include this nonce in the signed transcript, binding the authentication to that specific connection. Timestamps are checked within a 30-second skew window. Clients that omit the nonce or provide a mismatched nonce are rejected.

### Invitation Tokens

Invitation tokens are 256-bit secrets derived via HKDF. The relay stores only the HMAC commitment — never the raw token. Tokens are:

- **One-time use** (or configurable `max_uses`)
- **Time-limited** (configurable `expires_in_secs`)
- **Host-approved** — the relay forwards join requests to the host for explicit approval
- **Ed25519-signed** — invitation URLs include a signature binding the token to the server address and pool ID

### Proof-of-Work

Joining peers must solve a SHA-256 hashcash challenge before their request is forwarded to the host. Difficulty scales adaptively:

| Requests/min | Difficulty | Expected Hashes | Solve Time |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| 0-50         | 18 bits    | ~262k           | ~50ms      |
| 51-200       | 22 bits    | ~4M             | ~800ms     |
| 201+         | 26 bits    | ~67M            | ~13s       |

Challenges include a timestamp to prevent pre-computation and are verified within a time window.

### Rate Limiting

| Limit | Default | Scope |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Connection rate | 30/min | Per-IP (IPv6 /48 normalized) |
| Message rate | 60/sec | Per-connection |
| Failed auth | 5 attempts | Per-IP, then blocked |
| Block duration | 10 min | Per-IP |

### Session Tokens

After successful `HostAuth`, the server issues a 32-byte session token for the host. All privileged host operations require this token:

- `CreateInvitation`
- `RevokeInvitation`
- `JoinApproval`
- `KickPeer`
- `ClosePool`
- Host-originated `Forward`

Guest peers also receive a session token at join-approval time. The server stores each guest's token and validates it on every `Forward` frame. All token comparisons use constant-time equality (`subtle::ConstantTimeEq`) to prevent timing side-channels.

### Noise NK Handshake

The handshake follows the Noise NK pattern where the client knows the server's static X25519 public key (obtained via invitation or out-of-band):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Client: Generate ephemeral X25519 keypair
    Note over Client: shared_es = X25519(client_ephemeral_sk, server_static_pk)
    Client->>Server: client_ephemeral_pk, client_ed25519_pk, timestamp, signature

    Note over Server: Generate ephemeral X25519 keypair
    Note over Server: shared_ee = X25519(server_ephemeral_sk, client_ephemeral_pk)
    Server->>Client: server_ephemeral_pk, timestamp, signature

    Note over Client,Server: ikm = shared_es || shared_ee
    Note over Client,Server: session_keys = HKDF-SHA256(ikm, salt, info, 96)
```

This provides forward secrecy via ephemeral keys, server authentication via the static key (NK pattern), and client authentication via Ed25519 signature over the handshake transcript. All ephemeral secrets are zeroized after key derivation.

### Display Name Sanitization

All display names received from clients are sanitized before logging or storage: control characters and newlines are stripped, and length is truncated to 64 characters. This prevents log injection and terminal escape attacks.

### What the Relay Can and Cannot See

| Data | Visible to Relay? | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Connected peer IDs | Yes | Required for routing |
| Peer IP addresses | Yes | Required for TCP connections |
| Message routing metadata | Yes | Who sends to whom, when, message type |
| Message sizes and timing | Yes | Inherent in transport |
| Pool membership | Yes | Required for pool management |
| **Message content** | **No** | E2E encrypted (ChaCha20-Poly1305) |
| **Chat text** | **No** | Inside encrypted payload |
| **Game moves** | **No** | Inside encrypted payload |
| **Shared files** | **No** | Inside encrypted payload |
| **Pool codes** | **No** | Only HMAC commitments stored |
| **Invitation secrets** | **No** | Only HMAC commitments stored |

### Container Hardening

- Non-root user (`stealthos`)
- Read-only filesystem
- All Linux capabilities dropped (`--cap-drop ALL`)
- No shell in the image
- `no-new-privileges` security option
- 256 MB memory limit
- tmpfs for `/tmp` with `noexec,nosuid`

## Deployment

### Native Install (Recommended)

The fastest way to self-host on your own hardware — a laptop, desktop, or single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi.

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer:
- Downloads the correct binary for your OS and architecture (amd64 / arm64)
- Verifies the SHA256 checksum against the signed release
- Creates a system service (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS, Windows Service)
- Opens the setup page in your browser for one-click claiming

Supported platforms: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Arch, Alpine, Raspberry Pi OS, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Windows 10/11.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--version v1.0.0` | Install a specific version |
| `--update` | Update binary, preserve keys and config |
| `--uninstall` | Remove everything (prompts before deleting keys) |
| `--no-service` | Don't create a system service |
| `--no-browser` | Don't auto-open the browser |

### One-Click Deploy

Deploy StealthRelay to your preferred cloud provider:

| Provider | Deploy | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Railway** | [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/template?referralCode=olib&template=https://github.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay) | Persistent volume for keys, WebSocket native |
| **Render** | [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay) | Free tier available, persistent disk |
| **DigitalOcean** | [![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay/tree/main) | App Platform, auto-deploy on push |
| **Fly.io** | `fly launch --copy-config` | Global edge, persistent volume |

All providers terminate TLS at the edge — no certificate management needed.

### Docker Compose

The recommended self-hosted deployment method:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f stealth-relay
```

This provides:
- Persistent key volume (`stealth-keys`)
- Read-only config bind-mount
- Security hardening (read-only FS, no capabilities, no new privileges)
- Resource limits (256 MB memory, 2 CPUs)
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Log rotation (10 MB max, 3 files)

### Cloudflare Tunnel

For internet access without opening ports or managing TLS certificates:

```bash
# 1. Create a tunnel at https://one.dash.cloudflare.com → Networks → Tunnels
# 2. Set CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN in docker/.env
# 3. Deploy with the overlay compose file

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
               -f docker/docker-compose.cloudflared.yml up -d
```

The overlay removes the public WebSocket port binding — all traffic flows through the tunnel. Your relay will be available at `wss://your-tunnel-hostname`.

### Native TLS

For direct TLS termination without Cloudflare, configure `rustls` with your certificate and key files. ConnectionPool clients support SPKI SHA-256 pin verification via a custom `URLSessionDelegate` for certificate pinning.

## Development

```bash
# Build the workspace
cargo build --workspace

# Run all tests (166 unit tests)
cargo test --workspace

# Lint
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings

# Format check
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Run locally with pretty logging
STEALTH_CRYPTO__KEY_DIR=/tmp/stealth-keys \
STEALTH_LOGGING__FORMAT=pretty \
cargo run -p stealthos-server -- serve

# E2E test against a running server
./scripts/e2e-test.sh ws://localhost:9090

# Docker build
docker build -t stealth-relay .
```

## Recovery

If you lose access to your device:

1. Enter the **recovery key** (shown once at claim time) in the app
2. The server rebinds to your new device's key
3. A **new recovery key** is issued (the old one is invalidated)

If you lose the recovery key too, you must redeploy with a fresh key volume:

```bash
docker volume rm stealth-relay-keys
docker restart stealth-relay
```

## Requirements

- **Docker 24+** and **Compose v2.4+** (for deployment)
- **Rust 1.87+** with 2024 edition support (for building from source)
- **Platforms**: amd64, arm64
